# Process Scheduler Simulation

Simulates how an operating system schedules processes using various CPU scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- Select scheduler type
- Add process details:
  - Name
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority
- Calculate waiting time, turnaround time, and averages
- Display Gantt chart of the schedule
- Supports TRACE mode (timeline) and STATS mode (statistics)

## Supported Schedulers
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- RR (Round Robin)
- SPN (Shortest Process Next)
- SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)
- HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)
- FB-1 (Feedback Queue 1)
- FB-2i (Feedback Queue 2i)
- AGING
- PRIO (Priority Scheduling)
- MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)
